        <h3>This application serves as a simplified data entry tool.</h3>
        <p>The primary goal is to send collections of inputs to a server and seamlessly inserting them into a database. This stored data can then be retrieved on subsequent pages.</p>
        <p>On the second page, the application facilitates the visualization of data through graphs, drawing inspiration from real-world work scenarios.</p>
        <p>Moving to the third page, users can effortlessly request data presented in a tabular format, organized by product type. Additionally, a filter search field is provided to streamline data access.</p>
        <p>Fill out the page top to bottom and hopefully the place holder text will assist with the data entry.</p>
